## Getting Started

- Use `themes/saintly-base` as your working theme. Each feature has a placeholder section/snippet or JS file under `sections/`, `snippets/`, or `assets/js/`.
- Track progress in `/tasks` checklists or convert them to GitHub issues (templates included under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`).

## Repo Map
- `themes/saintly-base/` â€“ minimal Online Store 2.0 theme with placeholders
- `docs/` â€“ implementation guides per area (PLP, PDP, Drawer, Popups, etc.)
- `tasks/` â€“ markdown checklists split by main task
- `.github/` â€“ issue templates + CI (Theme Check)
